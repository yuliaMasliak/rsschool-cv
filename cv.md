### Profile summary:  
Have been working in marketing and public relations last 10 years I finally decided to switch and satrt learning programming. My main goal is to become a professional developer. At first I intend to study fundamentally Front-end, but later I plan also try to learn back-end languages.  
Since July 2022 I have been studying on my own, devoting approx. 8 hours per day to learning. During this time, I learned the basic languages of website layout (HTML, CSS) and JavaScript  Basics. I have gained an experience in makin web pages and website using such tools as API, axios, Bootstrap, Google fonts, React.
